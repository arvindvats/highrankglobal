            During the course of the "project" it is the client's responsibility
            to provide all (but not limited to the following) the relevant
            information, content, pictures, previous code etc... in order to
            make the project technically feasible and viable - in the absence of

            High Rank Advertising Private Limited will not be held responsible
            in case the client insists on using a particular "copyrighted"
            material - High Rank Advertising Private Limited would assume that
            the client has taken care of the legal and copyright implications of
            using the same and once the final payment and or the website has
            been made "live" it is deemed that the client has given the go ahead

            with necessary information, materials or feedback in a timely manner
            when requested (within 24 hours) it could become necessary to
            reschedule the team / resource to other projects while we are
            waiting. Any delay in re-allocating resources off the project during
            these waiting periods will be taken from the allocated project time.

            We undertake this work on the understanding that we will research
            and develop the existing code, but we make no guarantees that the

            upon client request, licensing reasons for example). This is done so
            at your own risk. We do not take responsibility for any impact this
            may have to either the live site or your ability to work. We
